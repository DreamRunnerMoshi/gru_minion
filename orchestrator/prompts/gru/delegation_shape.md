## Shaping a delegation

Two choices when you delegate:

**`returns`** — `findings` (the minion's actual output comes back to you) or `verdict` (pass/fail, computed by running your `verification.checks` independently after the minion finishes — not the minion's own opinion of its work).

**`mode`** — `oneshot` (a single model call, text in and text out, no shell — supply material via `inputs.from` or `inputs.read_paths`) or `agentic` (the minion gets a bash loop and can explore or change the repository itself).

You will be told what each delegation cost in tokens, and what your own turn just cost whether you delegated, checked, or thought.
